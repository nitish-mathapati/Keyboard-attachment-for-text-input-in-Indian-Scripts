# Keyboard-attachment-for-text-input-in-Indian-Scripts

# Solving difficulty of text input of  Indian languages in computers:
India has many spoken languages and different scripts. The main problem faced by text input in Indian scripts is, there is no reliable text input standard for Indian scripts. The language rely on IMEs (Input Method Editors) to input text in the desired scripts.

While India has 22 separate official languages, it is hom eto a total 121 languages & 270 mother tongues and has a population of about 141.72 crores.

So, we have built the project based on the above problem. Building a keyboard attachment that provides text input feature in multiple languages/scripts. This easily attachable hardware, to the keyboard provides text input features in different Indian languages. This tool is particularly useful in multilingual countries like India, where many languages have unique scripts and characters.
